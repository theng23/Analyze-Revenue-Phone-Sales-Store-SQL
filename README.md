## ‚öíÔ∏èIII. Exploring the Dataset
In this project, I will write 10 query in BigQuery and used Phone_Database.
### **Q1.How many orders per month?**
- SQL Code
``` sql
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATE('%Y %m',PARSE_DATE('%Y %m %d',DatePurchase)) AS month
  ,COUNT(DISTINCT TransactionID) AS count_order --count order 
FROM
  `hackathon-446917.midterm_SQL.hackaton_phones_sales`
GROUP BY 
  month
ORDER BY
  month
;
```
- Results: <br>

|month  |count_order|
|-------|-----------|
|2015 01|16963      |
|2015 02|19999      |
|2015 03|17944      |
|2015 04|19570      |
|2015 05|20830      |

**Conclusion:** Order volume fluctuates, peaking in May (20,830) and dipping in January (16,963). Seasonal demand or promotions may influence these shifts.

###  Q2. How many customers make purchases each month?

FROM
  `hackathon-446917.midterm_SQL.hackaton_phones_sales`

|21-25       |1462       |4272092000   |6         |6           |

**Conclusion** <br>
- The 26-30 age group is the age group that buys the most and has the second highest revenue after the 30-35 age group. This is a young age group and always follows the trend of updating new phone lines and accessories on the market, the life cycle of a product is short. However, the financial capacity of this group is not as strong as the 31-35 age group, so the products purchased by the 26-30 group will be at a lower price.

- The 31-35 age group is the leading age group in terms of revenue, and ranks second in terms of quantity sold. This age group has strong financial capacity, is willing to pay for more expensive products, equivalent to higher quality and a longer life cycle than the 26-30 group.
